title: In and Out 
---

**[verse 1 - outer me]** <br>
ding, goes the notification <br>
heck yea, my picture got a mention <br>
ok, ok <br>
let me see what’s happening real quick <br>
it’ll only be a minute, it’ll only be a click <br>
oh but wait, <br>
look where Carol goes to <br>
oh and snap, <br>
look at what Joe is up to <br>
I want my life to be interesting like that <br>
I want all my friends to envy me at last <br>

**[verse 2 - inner me]** <br>
cmon, be real <br>
your life isn’t a highlight reel <br> 
there’s nuance, and depth <br> 
it’s the ups and downs that give life breadth <br>
so what do you really want? <br>
ask it deeply <br>
cause all these distractions... <br>
they’ll cost you steeply <br> 

**[chorus]** <br>
(because I’m…) <br>
in and out of this life we call life <br>
tryna make sense of what’s wrong and what’s right <br>
right for him, wrong for me <br> 
that’s not who I want to be <br> 

**[verse 1 - outer me]** <br>
that image I put out isn’t me <br>
it’s who I feel the gram wants me to be <br>
how to get attention, what will come easy? <br>
I chase these likes, it makes me uneasy <br> 
and I don’t even see a reason to it <br> 
yet I continue to go on and do it <br> 
all so I can know your thinking of me <br>
all so you can be jealous, of who I don’t even want to be <br>

**[verse 2 - inner me]** <br>
calm down, calm down <br>
turn you’re phone off, shut down <br>
breathe in, breathe out <br>
no, stop it, put that damn phone down <br>
you’re not an exhibitionist, you’re not a voyeur <br> 
it’s such pettiness that makes your life poor <br> 
you need a break from these self-absorbed petty feeds <br>
you need to focus on some self-actualized needs <br>

**[chorus]** <br>
(because I’m…) <br>
in and out of this life we call life <br>
tryna make sense of what’s wrong and what’s right <br>
right for him, wrong for me <br> 
that’s not who I want to be <br>
