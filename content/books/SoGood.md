review: |
  Most useful career advice I've read. I'll admit, most of the insights now upon reflection seem obvious. Only goes to show how easy it is to wrap your thoughts around bad advice just cause it's sexier,i.e., follow your passion. Before you quit your job on a whim, read this book&mdash;I'm glad I did&mdash; and go build some career capital.(Only criticism: very repetitive--I recommend the audio version.)


directive: |
  Build career capital; let your passion follow you.

    in your quest to become really good at what you do" <br>

#### Q: How does one end up loving what they do?

Passion is an epiphenomenon of a working life well lived. Move your focus away from finding the right work and move it towards working right; and eventually you'll build a love for what you do.

*Science of passion:*

1. Career passions are rare (Most initial "passions" are hobby style interest.)
2. Passion takes time (The more experience one has, the more they love their work.)

*Craftsman mindset > Passion mindset*

Passion mindset: "Who am I" / "what do I truly love" – impossible to answer. You are trying to judge things in abstract before you do them, and it is hard to predict in advance what you'll eventually grow to love.

If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset –"what can the world offer me?" (false entitlement)– and instead adopt the craftsman–"what can I offer the world?".

Focus on getting better, focus on quality of what you produce.
