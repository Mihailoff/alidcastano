title: Reflect on your projects
---

As part of the redesign of this site, I added a [projects archive](/archives/projects). Going back and listing all the projects I've worked on the last two years made me notice two patterns:

- **I'm getting better at programming**. I'm no where near where I hope to be, and still feel somewhat like an imposter in this field. But I've been taking for granted how I'm not completely puzzled by foundational progamming principles, such as `closures` and `higher-order functions`, nor by Javascript's ugly parts, such as the `this`  context, anymore.

- **My projects are becoming more valuable**. This isn't just a result of growing more skilled. Part of becoming a better creator is acquiring a better taste for what projects to create. When you have no choice but to acknowledge the two months spent creating a somewhat-useless project, you learn quickly.

Going foward, I'll continue to create, but I'll be taking a break from working on open-source projects. I'm looking for a different sort of challange now and will be channeling my energy towards creating an idea that I've had for a while: Studbits.
