For a few years now I’ve had a feeling that note-taking could be done a lot better. I didn’t know exactly what “better” meant at first, I’d just notice I wasn’t making meaningful use of my notes—rarely reviewing them, and never sharing them with anyone. Note-taking felt like an underutilized, if not wasted, effort; so I started working on my own project, Studbits, to try to absolve this feeling.

While working on Studbits, I’ve realized why I felt resistance while using existing note-taking and social media apps. I take notes to capture my life’s most profound moments, the same someone might take pictures to capture their most enjoyable ones. So I’m extremely sensitive to the design of places where I collect and share them. They have to be thoughtful enough to encourage this behavior.

Thoughtful. That’s not usually the way software is described. But that’s certainly the way you experience it—as you use an app, it occupies space in your thoughts, just like a tool occupies space in your hands. 

The mind space an app occupies is easy to take for granted. It’s certainly not the sort of pitch you’d imagine getting an investors attention, nor one family and friends would understand for why you’re taking long to ship—or worse, considering a third rewrite. The feel of an app is too substantiate in a short conversation. So instead, I decided to write an essay about it.

### Subtly / Friction

For starters, it’s hard to fully describe what makes one product better than others. It’s not just a set of features that it has (or could have), features just make the product workable; but what makes a product great is how the entire idea comes together. All the subtleties that were accounted for overtime that allow you to use the product as intended.

On the surface of a product are its most obvious features. The ones that stand out in the activity itself. In regard to note-taking, for example, I used Evernote as a reference system because it organizes information for me (so I didn’t need to worry about it until I need to search for it), but Onenote for lecture notes because it lets me organize it myself (forcing me to care more about its structure). These experiences are readily apparent in the app, and so it’s easy to qualify their utility.

But there’s also the subtle features of an app. The ones we don’t explicitly notice impacting its use. When I needed to jot down a quick thought, for example, I couldn’t help but open up iNotes. Which spread my notes across yet another app. Why couldn’t I get myself to use Evernote’s mobile app instead? As I open both apps now, I do notice subtleties that can impact the writing process. Like the seconds it take to show the screen, or whether there’s a new note button on the first page. The disqualifier for Evernote is that its interface cluttered—there’s two toolbars (iNotes has one) and two placeholders (iNotes has zero) [1]; I have to think more about the tool and take focus away from my thought.

Though it’s not just lack of distraction that matters. Ideally, you want the action itself to feel natural. That’s in fact the most apparent feature in iNotes: its background looks like a slightly wrinkled sheet of paper. It’s encouraging me to scribble! 

All these are subtle features of an app that I felt first. I was only able to explain them now because of a competitor I was defaulting to that allowed me pick apart the experience.

In fact, it’s not just me defaulting to other apps. About a year ago I messaged a few people on Twitter and asked them what they used to take notes. The most popular answer I received was iNotes, the second most popular: Gmail.  

At the time I was surprised, if not dumbfounded. Here I was making a more sophisticated app, when their current go-to was one of the simplest, and the other one not even built for keeping notes. Though I realize now that it’s not that they wouldn’t appreciate a better tool for it, but that there’s subtleties in these use-cases that we’ve yet to fully unravel.

### Vibes / Atmosphere

Even above one feature or another, in the user’s mind, is the surface level appearance of the product itself. Just like the vibe of a restaurant sets the mood, the vibe of an app sets the atmosphere. As we hunch over to stare at small screen, minor details and their associations have an impression on us, and mediate how we feel when we use an app.

The most present vibe a product gives, for example, is from its colors. It’s enlightening to compare the main colors app and its core user. In the case of note apps: Evernote’s colors are green and black; these are the colors of money and late nights, so it’s fitting that their core user is working professionals. Onenote’s color is purple; I can’t readily think of anything that’s purple besides a flower, so putting this color on app seems elaborate and artificial; which is also fitting, since Onenote’s core user is students. As you make an app you get a feel what colors it should have, even if you can’t explain why until you associate them with its intended audience.

An app can also use neutral colors. Like blue and gray; they’re everywhere in nature, from skies to seas, so they appeal to a general audience. That’s of course why social apps—like Facebook and Twitter—use these two colors. But usage is still tainted by other factors. In fact, that’s an issue we’re seeing: since they cater to everyone, don’t charge users, and chase engagement metrics, so the design of their algorithms is driven by the scrolls of mindless users. That’s not to say people only partake in stupid and angry things, and we should discourage them—it’s human nature to escape or vent periodically. But people also like partaking in meaningful things, yet it’s not the sort of information we’re sharing at the same scale; and it’s because this sort of behavior can’t be measured by immediate metrics—it requires being thoughtful about design.

Another color tactic is to use a white or gray background and black text, and let the content itself shape the atmosphere—that’s what Instagram and Medium do. This actually works well for pictures, since they’re already colorful. But with text, these plain colors don’t give the site much personality, so the content itself feels serious. You sense this when you use Medium. As a writer, you’re given an entire page to fill, and even if readers won’t see it as a half-finished page, you’re writing amongst other writers who are likely to fill it. There’s always a weight imposed by a design, and that shapes the content that’s share there. On Instagram, it’s colorful, fun pictures; on Medium it’s long, insightful posts.  Their design sets the expectation of life as one big highlight reel, and genuine human expression suffers as a result.

Before writing this, I used to view color psychology with the same credibility as horoscopes. But while thinking about what it meant to feel an app, and vibe with it, its colors were front and center, I couldn’t help but focus on it.

An app’s colors leave a mark on its designers, too. Designing Studbits made this clear for me. Laying out various elements on a screen in a legible manner, with a pleasant contrast, is surprisingly difficult; especially when you can’t expect bright pictures or videos or albums to add complexion to the screen. I imagine that’s one factor limiting the information we share online—it’s harder to design a platform around user generated text. It requires both designers and users to engage with the app more mindfully.

### Values / Culture

The experience of a using an app isn’t just based on static features. It’s also based on relationship we build with the company that runs it. A company’s values might be the most understated feature of all, because even if a product is great, its emergent culture impacts whether we continue to use it.

Needless to say, we’ve all experienced the distasteful values of certain apps. *Cough* Facebook *Cough* Uber *Cough.*Their products is great, but there culture is not. So we delete them, and re-download them. Some of us eventually stop going back, the rest look down as we wait for a better alternative.

### Thoughts / Design 

If we want to engage more meaningfully online, we have to care more about software that’s thoughtfully designed—about the subtle features that remove friction from the experience, the vibes the product gives off that enhance its atmosphere, and the values of the company running the product that make us product to use it.

Every variable makes a difference. A frictionless experience gives us room to think; a welcoming atmosphere encourages us to express ourselves; and an upstanding culture reinforces positive behavior. The entire experience has to be congruent to create a space that encourages meaningful engagement. 

As I summarize these takeaways, it does feel like a lot to ask for. But maybe that’s a sign of untapped experiences in the products we use. At the very least, thoughtful design is worth aiming for; I’m sure there’s new kinds of emergent behaviors left to be discovered.
