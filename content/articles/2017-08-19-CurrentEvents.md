title: "News, sports, and pop-culture: My opinion"

The other day my friend said to me, “You value knowledge and being cultured. I still don't get it. How do you not read the news?”

I tried to find a sophisticated answer, but the truth was simpler than that: I don't care enough.

I care enough to ask about the the incident and, once informed, to partake in a conversation about the ideas and values contained in the event. But I don't care enough to constantly stay up to date with the daily chatter of what happened yesterday. It's too much effort for too small of a picture.

In fact, I've noticed a general theme in my life: a distaste for current events. Along with the news, I stay away from politics, I don't follow sports, and I'm largely out of tune with pop-culture. These activies may feel like more sophisticated forms of gossip, but they're still gossip. And since I never feel like a better person after going out of my way to partake in them, that's always been a sign for me not to actively seek it out.

That's not to say that I'm completely uninformed about the world. The beauty of it is, that since most people are so entralled with current events, the really important stuff you can't avoid. So I end up finding out the headlines eventually, just not during my morning coffee.
