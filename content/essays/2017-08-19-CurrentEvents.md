title: "News, sports, and pop-culture: My opinion"

The other day my friend said to me, “You value knowledge and being cultured. I don't get it. How do you not read the news?”

I tried to find a sophisticated answer, but the truth was simpler: I don't care enough.

I care enough to ask about the the incident and, once informed, to partake in a conversation about the values that pertain to the event. But I don't care enough to stay up to date with the daily chatter of what happened yesterday. It's too much effort for too small of a picture.

In fact, I've noticed a general theme in my life: a distaste for current events. Along with the news, I stay away from politics, I don't follow sports, and I'm largely out of tune with pop-culture. These actives feel like sophisticated forms of gossip. I never feel like a better person after going out of my way to partake in them, so that's always been a sign for me not to actively seek them out.

That's not to say that I'm completely uninformed about the world. The beauty of it is, since most people are so enthralled with current events, the really important stuff you can't avoid. So I end up finding out the headlines eventually, just not during my morning coffee.
