// this can either be about art=skill

// but not trying 

"I'm not creative"
No, "you don't do creative work"

creative work means sitting at a computer
not knowing how to say things the way you want to say them
struggling
failing
getting better over time

I always wondered, why don’t more artists write their own songs? Only reason I wanted to write music was cause I felt my expeinces weren’t captured by current music.  Ur then when I started trying to write my own, i realize why. 

It’s technically hard. Not just the rhyming but the whole composition of a song. I needed to learn how to think about it. Not the sort of work all people are willing to put in to get food at sketching.

Skill just as much as programming. I needed to apply same sort of dedication and practice. I always thought it was this innate talent, you either had flow or you didn’t. But turns out it can be worked on. 

Like the first time I did Dips. Fist time I could barely do any. Next time 5. Next time 10x it’s a lot hard now to improve. But at least it flows.

Same with song writing. First time I could barely compose a single thought wel enough. But I quit and love don. Few months later I tried again. My little brother was making music and it inspired me,
