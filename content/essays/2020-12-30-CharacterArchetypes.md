title: Character Archetypes

Telling my little brother to "be a man!" I could tell my other brother, Juan, was thinking, "man this guy is such a conservative, mysogynist" 

but it's not that. these are powerful archetypes for what should aim to be. otherwise you're left having to figure rigth for worng on a per case basis.

it's hurtful to use them in situations where theyb don't apply, i.e. a man that doesn't want to be "manly" (??) but it's also hurtful to not let us use them where they do.
