living in my head
and with a pwoerful community

Why am I traveling?
- dollar goes further
- get to *slowly* see different cultures 
- get to meet new people whereas I wouldn't have otherwise back home


What do I love about working remotely?
My dollar goes further. I can live like a king.
Easier to meet people. But those relationships are transient.

What do I dislike?
Constantly feel like I need to do things.
Waste so much time learning about neighborhoods, switching apartments, etc. 

most important thing isn't where you're at, it's community.
novelty wears off; worse, it gets tiring 
we all just want to settle down 
only people who don't are the ones who'se lively hood depends on it
we shouldn't envy them, we should feel sorry for them
there not enjoying their life as much as you think
they're enjoying the image of it


even when im in a fancy restaraunt,
i don't particularly care to be there, i just want some good food
efverything extra, well, my ego likes it
i like an idea of eating in a fancy restaruant by myself

ego likes the fluff. but your true self doesn't care for it
or at least that is how im wired


I'm fortunate enough to be working remotely and traveling. But honestly, I don't enjoy it as much as image would have it. 

Traveling the world versus Living in my head

Too much of the novelty I don't want.

Sure, it's cool to see a different culture.


Because exploring the world and experiencing different cultures is not my main priority right now.

What's the point in living in Medellin if I'm going to be doing the same thing I could be doing at home? Sitting in my laptop all day.

Sure, I can be somewhere and meet people, but most of those relationships are transient, just like traveling is.
