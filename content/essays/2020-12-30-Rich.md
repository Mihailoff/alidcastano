If I was rich, what would I be doing differently with my life? 

To the extent that I wouldn't be doing anything different 
if i was rich

I wouldn’t have this contracting job, but most of my spare time I’d likely be living the same.

I likely wouldn’t be traveling. I’d be making friends in San Francisco.

But what’s funny, is that for the most part,  money wouldn’t sovle the biggest problem I have in my life: meaning.

you're life isn't exactly how you want it to be, but that most of the things you could be doing are within you're control
you're either choosing not to do them because you really want to do it as much as you want it to be


i.e. musicina
like the idea of makign music
but do I have it in me to do what it takes to be great?

rich - money versus meaning - would i be doing anything different?
famous - envy versus admire versus want to be - how bad do i want this?
traveling - originadry versus original
serious - laugh at yourself
