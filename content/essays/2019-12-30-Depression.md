The scary truth about depression: most people think they're above it until they have it. So if and when it happens for the first time, they don't see it for what it is. 

The way we look at the psyche. and mental illness in general.
// testament to how we talk about mental health
// like it's an illness, rather than a truth about life.
// We have no idea why we exists, and we willignly choose to give our life meaning
// we doubt our abilities eveyrday, yet someone starts to doubt life a bit and we look at them and say "Hey man, you okay, what's wrrong with you"

//
I know that that feels like. It's when my project wasn't going well and I kept hammering away at it. When what I needed to do was take a step back and travel.

unless you're blessed to be around great like minded friends, and you're project is going well, it's hard to not want to do great work and not fight with depression. so spend so much time alone, isolated, because your work is what matters

idealy you'd be able to balnace work and play. people are quick to judge, but how many of us always do what we say we're going to do? Almost no one and almost never.

 and walking by the knife drawer, picking up a knife and thinking "What if?" and laughing as they walk away and get back to working in their project.
--- people who work a lot are victims. 
but also people with just shitty lives..hmm

might seem like a normal caring response, but the connoation is that what you'rer feeling is unhealthy and you need to get out of it.
we're afraid to feel. were afraid to look at life for what it really is.
People are afraid to look over the edge.
no me. I say yea man, been there too, I know how you feel.

having a quick peak and knowing you won't jump can be liberating.
my life sucks, it can get any worse, what can I do to make it better?

or, i was close to killing ymself and now i find myself wasting time 
why don't i do something that gives my life some meaning

It's easy to paint certain habits as normal. You have the flexibility to sleeping-in for a few hours everyday, and so you think it's normal, you're just tired. And cold places exasperate this feeling because you have a valid excuse for not wanting to go outside, which makes it easy to forget how good exercise and fresh air can feel.
 
Your mind can be the most wonderful and disastrous place to live in. IT was that winter that I realized what "the mind can make a heaven out of hell" really meant, because I saw its opposite.
