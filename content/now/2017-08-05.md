I'm temporarily working 9-6 (with some free time in beween) as Head of Operations at an event planning company. I'm doing it as a favor for a close friend, but the benefit is, I get to experiment with working remotely and living in New York.

I've finishing up my work on [Nuxtent](/projects/nuxtent), a Nuxt.js content module. I built it primarily so that I could port my site over from Jekyll to Nuxt. In fact, as we speak, I'm in the process of doing so, and as I redesign it, I'm drawing inspiration from [Utterson](/projects/utterson). (*Note: I also recently created the [Nuxtent documentation](https://nuxtent.now.sh/guide) using Nuxtent itself, and ported over the [Ency.js documentation](https://ency.now.sh/guide) to Nuxtent, too.*)

For the next few weeks, my main focus will be applying to jobs (my temporary employment ends in September). I'll also be creating [Studbits](/projects/studbits)-and following through this time.

Finally, now that my site is basically ready, I'm aiming to write more; or at least, whenever inspiration hits I'll have no excuse not to write, since I'll know my thoughts now have a home.
