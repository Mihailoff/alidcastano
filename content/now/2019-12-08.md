I'm still exploring the intersection of [note-taking and social media](https://alidlo.com/thoughtful-design). Originally my project was called Studbits; if you're interested here's version [one](http://v1.studbits.com/alid) and [two](studbits.com). This next version has a new, unannounced name, which I believe is truer to what I intend to create.

This time, however, I've decided to move away from Javascript/Node. I'm learning a new programming language called Clojure. It's a dialect of Lisp, and I've enjoyed learning it. Recently wrote about it [here](/lisp) and [here](/lisp-terse).

I'm also still doing contracting work--it pays the bills. But I'm lucky enough to be working remotely. I spent the last five months in Colombia. Then came back home to Minneapolis for holidays, and will stay here for a few months to work without distractions. Then, Mexico!
