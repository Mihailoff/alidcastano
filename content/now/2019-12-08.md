I'm still exploring a side project of mine called Studbits. This next version will be my third experiment; if you're interested here's version [one](http://v1.studbits.com/alid) and [two](studbits.com).

This time, however, I've decided to move away from Javascript/Node. I'm learning a new programming language called Clojure.

So, I've been spending most of my days doing contracting work, learning Clojure, and soon again, I'll be working on Studbits.

I'm also fortunate enough to be working remotely right now. I spent the last five months in Colombia. Came back home for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but for 2020 planning to explore Mexico next.
