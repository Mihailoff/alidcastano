title: create, create, create
---

no reason not to, create <br>
even if you suck <br>
you’re bound to get better <br>
even without luck <br> 
you’re bound to find treasure <br> 

create, create, create <br>
even if it's a picture no one sees <br>
or a caption no one reads <br>
likes or not rest assured <br>
the only eyes that matter are yours <br>

so go on, create <br>
even if it’s an app no one needs <br>
or a product without leads <br> 
you don’t do it for anyone after all <br>
you do it for yourself, for some inner call <br> 

so go on, create <br> 
there's no such thing as being too early <br>
when something inside you calls you surely <br>
create, create, create <br> 
there's no such thing as being too late <br> 
when something inside you just can’t wait <br>

create, create, create <br>
it’s in those moments your hearts beaming <br>
create, create, create <br> 
it’s what gives life meaning <br>
