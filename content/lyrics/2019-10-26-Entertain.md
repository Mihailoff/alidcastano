title: entertaining myself
---

singers and rappers, I feel <br>
aren't making rhymes I find surreal <br>
all this stuff bout booty shakin' and baby makin' <br>
that's not what I have in mind <br>
life for me isn’t one big pastime <br>
so ima make the rhymes I feel <br> 
ima try and be the real deal <br>

<div></div>

sure, my rhymes seem elementary <br>
but that’s just right of entry <br> 
i’ll start simple, i’ll start slow <br>
maybe one day it’ll be me, putting on a show <br> 
i entertain any idea of myself I like <br>
no such thing as wasted time, no two people are alike <br>
this might seem childlike, perhaps <br>
but I don’t do it for money, for that I make apps <br>
