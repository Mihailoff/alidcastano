title: entertaining myself
---

my rhymes might seem elementary <br>
but that’s just right of entry <br> 
i’ll start simple, I’ll start slow <br>
maybe one day it’ll be me, putting on a show <br> 
i entertain any idea of myself I like <br>
no such thing as wasted time, no two people are alike <br>
this might seem childlike, perhaps <br>
but I don’t do it for money, for that I make apps <br>
