      p I'm a recent graduate from Upenn, the creator of Ency.js, and founder of Studbits.
      p I'm fascinated by startups, fitness, usable psychology, and conscious growth. My life philosophy is a mix between Stocisim and Objectivism.
      p I was born in Colombia, raised in Miami, educated in Philly, and I'm currently residing in NYC.
      p I speak English, Spanish, German, and Javascript.
      p Here is where I write about my thoughts, consolidate what I learn, record my work, and establish my priorities.
